# Working with remotes

<InfoBox type="tip">
A **remote** is just a saved nickname for a Git server URL (like GitHub). The most common remote is called `origin`.
</InfoBox>

## What is a remote?

- Local repo: on your machine
- Remote repo: shared copy on a server (GitHub/GitLab)

## Remote-tracking branches (what you see after fetch)

When you fetch, Git updates references like:

- `origin/main`

That’s Git’s “notes” about what the remote has.

Check remotes:

```bash
git remote -v
```

## Fetch vs pull (super important)

- `git fetch`: download updates, **do not** merge them
- `git pull`: fetch + integrate (merge or rebase)

```bash
git fetch
```

```bash
git pull
```

## Push (send your commits to the remote)

Push sends your local commits to the remote:

```bash
git push
```

First push on a new branch often sets upstream:

```bash
git push -u origin feature/login
```

## Common collaboration pattern

1) Fetch or pull often
2) Work on a branch
3) Push your branch
4) Open a Pull Request (PR)
