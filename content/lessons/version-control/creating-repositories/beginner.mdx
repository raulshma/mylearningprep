# Creating repositories

<InfoBox type="tip">
A **repository** (repo) is a project folder with an attached Git history.
</InfoBox>

## Repo mental model

- Your project files live in a normal folder.
- Git stores history in a hidden folder called **.git**.

<KeyConcept title="The .git folder">
`.git` is where Git keeps commits, branches, tags, and the staging area. If you delete it, you delete the repo history.
</KeyConcept>

## Option A: Start a new repo (git init)

Use this when you already have a project folder and want to start tracking it.

```bash
cd my-project

git init
```

Then check status:

```bash
git status
```

<InfoBox type="tip">
If you see “On branch main”, you’re good. If it says “master”, don’t worry—branch names can be configured.
</InfoBox>

## Make your first commit

1) Stage files:

```bash
git add .
```

2) Commit:

```bash
git commit -m "chore: initial commit"
```

## Option B: Copy an existing repo (git clone)

Use this when a repo already exists (for example on GitHub).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OWNER/REPO.git
```

This downloads the repo history **and** the working files.
