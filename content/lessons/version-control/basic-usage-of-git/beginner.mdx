# Basic Usage of Git

<InfoBox type="tip">
Git is like a **time machine for your project**:
- you can save checkpoints (commits)
- you can compare “what changed?” (diff)
- you can go back safely (restore)
</InfoBox>

## Why Git exists

When you build features, you’re constantly making edits you *might* want to undo. Git helps you:

- keep a history of changes
- explain *why* a change happened (commit messages)
- collaborate without overwriting each other

## The 3 places your code can live (the Git mental model)

Git has a simple workflow if you remember the **3 places**:

1. **Working tree**: your files (what you’re editing)
2. **Staging area**: what you *intend* to include in the next commit
3. **Repository**: your commits (history)

<KeyConcept title="Why staging matters">
Staging lets you choose *exactly* what goes into the next commit. You can work on multiple things, but only commit the part that’s ready.
</KeyConcept>

## The everyday workflow: status → add → commit

Think of staging like a shopping cart:

- you edit files (items on the shelves)
- you add selected files to the cart (stage)
- you check out (commit)

### 1) Check what changed

```bash
git status
```

### 2) Stage changes

Stage a file:

```bash
git add path/to/file
```

Stage everything:

```bash
git add .
```

### 3) Commit (save a checkpoint)

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add signup form"
```

## Look around: diff and log

### See what changed (before committing)

```bash
git diff
```

### See what you staged

```bash
git diff --staged
```

### See history

```bash
git log --oneline --decorate
```

## Safe undo (beginner-friendly)

Undo local file edits (restore from the last commit):

```bash
git restore path/to/file
```

Unstage a file (keep edits, just remove from staging):

```bash
git restore --staged path/to/file
```

<InfoBox type="warning">
Be careful with commands that *rewrite history* (like some uses of `reset`). As a beginner, prefer `git restore` and small commits.

## Summary

<KeyConcept title="Your Git loop">
1) `git status` to see what’s going on
2) `git add` to stage what you want
3) `git commit` to save a checkpoint
4) `git diff` / `git log` to review
5) `git restore` to undo safely
</KeyConcept>
