# Control Flow: Making Decisions in Your Code

Imagine you're at a crossroad. Do you go left or right? In programming, your code faces similar decisions constantly. **Control flow** is how we tell our programs to make choices!

## What is Control Flow?

<KeyConcept title="The Traffic Light Analogy" icon="traffic-light">
Think of control flow like a traffic light:

- **Red** = Stop (don't run this code)
- **Green** = Go (run this code)
- **The condition** = The light sensor that decides which signal shows

Your code checks a condition and decides which path to take!

## The if/else Statement

The most basic decision in C#:

```csharp
int score = 75;

if (score >= 60)
{
    Console.WriteLine("You passed!");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("Try again.");
}
```

Let's break this down:

| Part | What It Does |
|:-----|:-------------|
| `if (condition)` | Checks if something is true |
| `{ }` | The code block to run if true |
| `else` | What happens if the condition is false |

## See It In Action

Watch how the computer makes decisions:

<ControlFlowVisualizer type="if-else" />

> **Notice:** When the score is 75, the condition `75 >= 60` is TRUE, so we enter the `if` block!

## Real-World Example: Age Check

```csharp
int age = 20;

if (age >= 18)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Welcome to the movie!");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("Sorry, this movie is for adults.");
}
```

Think of this like a bouncer at a club - they check your age and decide if you can enter!

## Key Takeaways

<InfoBox type="tip" title="Remember the Pattern">
1. `if` checks a condition
2. If TRUE → run the first block
3. If FALSE → run the `else` block (optional)
4. Always use `{ }` curly braces for clarity!
</InfoBox>

> **Pro Tip:** The condition inside `if()` must evaluate to true or false (a boolean). Numbers and strings won't work directly!
