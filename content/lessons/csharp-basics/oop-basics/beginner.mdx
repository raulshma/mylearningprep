# OOP Basics: Classes and Objects

Welcome to Object-Oriented Programming! This is how C# organizes code into reusable, logical pieces.

## What is OOP?

<KeyConcept title="The Cookie Cutter Analogy" icon="cookie">
Think of baking cookies:

- **Class** = The cookie cutter (the BLUEPRINT)
- **Object** = Each actual cookie (the THING you make)

One cookie cutter can make many cookies. One class can create many objects!
</KeyConcept>

## What is a Class?

A **class** is a blueprint that defines:
- What **data** something has (properties)
- What it can **do** (methods)

```csharp
// This is a CLASS - a blueprint for cars
public class Car
{
    // Properties - what a car HAS
    public string Brand { get; set; }
    public string Color { get; set; }
    public int Year { get; set; }
    
    // Method - what a car can DO
    public void Honk()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Beep beep!");
    }
}
```

## What is an Object?

An **object** is a real instance created from a class:

```csharp
// Creating an OBJECT from the Car class
Car myCar = new Car();

// Setting its properties
myCar.Brand = "Toyota";
myCar.Color = "Red";
myCar.Year = 2024;

// Calling its method
myCar.Honk();  // Output: Beep beep!
```

## The new Keyword

The `new` keyword creates an object in memory:

```csharp
// This creates a new Car object
Car myCar = new Car();
```

| Part | Meaning |
|:-----|:--------|
| `Car` | The type of object |
| `myCar` | The variable name (reference) |
| `new Car()` | Creates the object in memory |

## Multiple Objects

You can create many objects from one class:

```csharp
Car car1 = new Car();
car1.Brand = "Toyota";
car1.Color = "Red";

Car car2 = new Car();
car2.Brand = "Honda";
car2.Color = "Blue";

// car1 and car2 are DIFFERENT objects
// Each has its own data!
```

## Key Takeaways

<InfoBox type="tip" title="Remember">
- **Class** = Blueprint (defines structure)
- **Object** = Instance (actual thing in memory)
- **Properties** = Data the object stores
- **Methods** = Actions the object can perform
- Use `new` to create objects from classes
</InfoBox>

> **Pro Tip:** Think of classes like blueprints for a house. The blueprint says "3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms" but it's not a house - it's instructions. When you BUILD a house from that blueprint, that's the object!
