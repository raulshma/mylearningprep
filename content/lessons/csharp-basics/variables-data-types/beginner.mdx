# Variables & Data Types in C#

Imagine you're organizing a toy box. Each toy needs a labeled container - a box for blocks, a box for cars, and a box for dolls. In C#, **variables** are like those labeled containers, and **data types** tell us what kind of toy (data) can go inside!

## What is a Variable?

A variable is simply a container with a name that holds some information. Just like you might label a jar "cookies" to remember what's inside, we name our variables to remember what data they store.

> **Think of it this way:**
>
> A variable is like a labeled box in your room. The label is the variable name, and whatever's inside is the value!

  code={`// Creating a variable is like labeling a box
string petName = "Fluffy";
int petAge = 3;
bool isHappy = true;`}
  steps={[
    {
      lineNumbers: [2],
      highlight: "Creating a text variable",
      explanation: "string means this box holds text (words)",
      variables: { petName: "\"Fluffy\"" }
    },
    {
      lineNumbers: [3],
      highlight: "Creating a number variable",
      explanation: "int means this box holds whole numbers",
      variables: { petName: "\"Fluffy\"", petAge: "3" }
    },
    {
      lineNumbers: [4],
      highlight: "Creating a true/false variable",
      explanation: "bool means this box holds true or false",
      variables: { petName: "\"Fluffy\"", petAge: "3", isHappy: "true" }
    }
  ]}

## The Most Common Data Types

Here are the data types you'll use most often, explained with simple analogies:

| Type | What it Holds | Example | Analogy |
|:-----|:--------------|:--------|:--------|
| `int` | Whole numbers | `42`, `-7` | Counting apples |
| `string` | Text/words | `"Hello"` | A sentence in a book |
| `bool` | True or false | `true`, `false` | A light switch (on/off) |
| `double` | Decimal numbers | `3.14`, `99.99` | Measuring ingredients |

## Naming Your Variables

Just like naming a pet, there are some rules for naming variables:

- ✅ Start with a letter (like `score` or `playerName`)
- ✅ Can include numbers after the first letter (`player1`)
- ✅ Use camelCase for readability (`totalScore`, not `totalscore`)
- ❌ No spaces allowed (`player name` is wrong)
- ❌ Can't start with a number (`1stPlace` is wrong)

## Let's Practice!

<DotnetCodePreview
  title="Variable Playground"
  code={`// Create variables for a simple game
string playerName = "Alex";
int score = 100;
double health = 99.5;
bool isAlive = true;

// Use the variables
Console.WriteLine("Player: " + playerName);
Console.WriteLine("Score: " + score);`}
  steps={[
    {
      lineNumbers: [2, 3, 4, 5],
      highlight: "Setting up game data",
      explanation: "We create four boxes to hold different game information",
      variables: { playerName: "\"Alex\"", score: "100", health: "99.5", isAlive: "true" }
    },
    {
      lineNumbers: [8, 9],
      highlight: "Using our variables",
      explanation: "We can read what's in our boxes and display it",
      output: "Player: Alex\nScore: 100"
    }
  ]}
/>

## Quick Summary

- **Variables** = labeled containers for storing data
- **Data types** = rules about what kind of data can go in the container
- **int** = whole numbers
- **string** = text
- **bool** = true/false
- **double** = decimal numbers
