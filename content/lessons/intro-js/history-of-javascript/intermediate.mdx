# The Browser Wars

The mid-1990s were a turbulent time in tech history. The battle for browser dominance shaped JavaScript's evolution in ways that still affect us today.

## Netscape vs. Microsoft

In 1995, **Netscape Navigator** was the dominant web browser with about 80% market share. When JavaScript (originally called Mocha, then LiveScript) was released in Netscape Navigator 2.0, it gave Netscape a significant competitive advantage.

Microsoft responded quickly. In 1996, they released **Internet Explorer 3.0** with their own version called **JScript**. While similar to JavaScript, JScript had subtle differences that would cause headaches for developers for years to come.

## The Compatibility Nightmare

```javascript
// 1990s code had to check which browser was being used
if (document.all) {
  // Internet Explorer
  element = document.all('myId');
} else if (document.getElementById) {
  // Netscape and others
  element = document.getElementById('myId');
}
```

This era gave birth to the infamous phrase: **"Best viewed in Internet Explorer"** (or Netscape) that plagued websites for years.

## Key Timeline Events

| Year | Event | Significance |
|:-----|:------|:-------------|
| **1995** | JavaScript created | Brendan Eich, Netscape |
| **1996** | JScript released | Microsoft's response |
| **1996** | JavaScript submitted to ECMA | Start of standardization |
| **1997** | ECMAScript 1 released | First official standard |
| **1999** | ECMAScript 3 released | Added regex, try/catch |
| **2005** | AJAX coined | Asynchronous web apps (Gmail) |
| **2006** | jQuery released | "Write less, do more" |

## The AJAX Revolution

In 2005, Google Gmail and Google Maps showed the world what JavaScript could really do. The technique was called **AJAX** (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML):

```javascript
// The XMLHttpRequest object changed everything
const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open('GET', '/api/messages');
xhr.onreadystatechange = function() {
  if (xhr.readyState === 4 && xhr.status === 200) {
    updateInbox(JSON.parse(xhr.responseText));
  }
};
xhr.send();
```

This allowed web pages to update parts of themselves without full page reloads - a revolutionary concept at the time.
