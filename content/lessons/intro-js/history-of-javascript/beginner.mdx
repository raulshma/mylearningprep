# The Story of JavaScript

Once upon a time, in the year **1995**, the internet was a very different place. Websites were like digital brochures - you could look at them, but you couldn't really *do* anything with them.

## The 10-Day Miracle

A programmer named **Brendan Eich** was working at a company called Netscape. His boss gave him a wild challenge:

> "Create a programming language for the web browser... in just 10 days!"

And amazingly, he did it! In May 1995, Brendan created the first version of what would become JavaScript.

## What's in a Name?

JavaScript went through some name changes (like many of us!):

| Date | Name | Why? |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| May 1995 | **Mocha** | Original code name |
| September 1995 | **LiveScript** | Sounded cool and "alive" |
| December 1995 | **JavaScript** | Marketing - Java was popular! |

> **Fun Fact:** JavaScript has nothing to do with Java! The name was chosen for marketing reasons because Java was the "hot" language at the time. It's like naming your dog "Simba" because The Lion King was popular!

## A Rocky Start

At first, many programmers didn't take JavaScript seriously. They called it a "toy language" just for adding little effects to web pages.

But look at JavaScript now:
- **Most popular language** on GitHub
- Powers nearly **every website** you visit
- Runs servers, mobile apps, and even robots!

JavaScript went from a "toy" to the **king of programming languages**.
