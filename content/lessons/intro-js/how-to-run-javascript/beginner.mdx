# Running JavaScript in Your Browser

Did you know your web browser already has a built-in "playground" for JavaScript? It's called the **Console**.

## The Browser Console

Developers use the console to test code quickly and find errors. Let's try it!

1. Right-click anywhere on this page and select **Inspect**.
2. Click the tab labeled **Console**.
3. You should see a blinking cursor or `>`.

### Try This!

Type this code into your console and press Enter:

```javascript
alert("Hello from the console!");
```

You should see a pop-up window! That's JavaScript running instantly.

## The Script Tag

To save JavaScript code so it runs every time a page loads, we use the `<script>` tag in HTML.

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>My Website</h1>

    <script>
      // JavaScript goes here!
      console.log("The page has loaded!");
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

The browser reads the HTML file top-to-bottom. When it sees `<script>`, it stops to run the JavaScript code inside.

<CodePlayground
  initialCode="console.log('I am running inside the browser!');"
  mode="javascript"
/>
