# JWT, OAuth, and SSO (Beginner)

<InfoBox type="info" title="Goal">
By the end, you’ll be able to explain **what a JWT is**, **what OAuth is for**, and **what SSO means** — without mixing them up.
</InfoBox>

## 1) JWT: a tamper-proof “badge” of claims

Think of a **JWT** (JSON Web Token) like a **laminated badge**.

- It contains **claims** (little facts): who you are (`sub`), who issued it (`iss`), who it’s for (`aud`), when it expires (`exp`).
- It’s **signed**, so it can’t be modified without being detected.

<KeyConcept title="JWT in one sentence">
A JWT is a compact, URL-safe way to carry signed claims between parties.
</KeyConcept>

<InfoBox type="warning" title="JWT ≠ login">
A JWT is not automatically “authentication”. It’s just a token format. Whether it *means* you’re logged in depends on your system.
</InfoBox>

## 2) OAuth: a “valet key” for APIs

OAuth is about **delegated authorization**.

Analogy: You give a valet a **key that can only park the car**, not open your house.

- You (the user) don’t share your password with the app.
- The app receives an **access token** that can call an API.

<InfoBox type="tip" title="Modern recommendation">
Prefer **Authorization Code + PKCE** for browser-based and mobile clients.

## 3) SSO: “log in once, access many apps”

SSO (Single Sign-On) means:

- You sign in to an **Identity Provider (IdP)** once.
- Many apps can trust that IdP, so you don’t re-enter credentials everywhere.

Common SSO building blocks:

- **OpenID Connect (OIDC)**: “OAuth + identity” (adds an ID token and standard identity claims)
- **SAML**: older but still common in enterprises

<InfoBox type="info" title="What you should remember">
SSO is the *experience*. OAuth/OIDC/SAML are the *protocols* that implement it.
</InfoBox>

## Quick recap

- **JWT** is a token format (signed claims).
- **OAuth** is delegated authorization (get limited access without sharing passwords).
- **SSO** is a user experience often implemented with **OIDC** or **SAML**.
