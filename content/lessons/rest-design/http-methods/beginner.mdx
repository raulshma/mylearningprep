# HTTP Methods & Status Codes: The Language of the Web

When computers talk to each other on the web, they use a specific language. Just like you need verbs to communicate ("get," "create," "delete"), web APIs use **HTTP Methods**. And just like you need feedback ("done!", "error!"), APIs use **Status Codes**.

## Section 1: The HTTP Methods - Your Action Verbs 🎬

Think of HTTP methods as commands you give to a librarian:

### GET - "Please Show Me" 📖

**What it does:** Retrieves information without changing anything.

**Real-world analogy:** 
- Looking at a book in the library (you don't take it home)
- Checking your bank balance (just viewing, not withdrawing)

```
GET /api/users/123
→ "Show me information about user 123"
```

**Key rule:** GET should NEVER change data. It's read-only!

### POST - "Please Add This" ➕

**What it does:** Creates something new.

```
POST /api/users
Body: { "name": "John", "email": "john@example.com" }
→ "Create a new user with this information"
```

**Key rule:** POST creates new things. Each time you POST, you create another one!

### PUT - "Replace Everything" 🔄

**What it does:** Replaces an entire resource with new data.

```
PUT /api/users/123
Body: { "name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com", "age": 30 }
→ "Replace ALL information for user 123 with this"
```

**Key rule:** You must send the COMPLETE object. Missing fields get deleted!

### DELETE - "Remove This" 🗑️

**What it does:** Removes a resource.

```
DELETE /api/users/123
→ "Remove user 123 from the system"
```

### Quick Comparison Table 📊

| Method | Action | Example | Changes Data? |
|:-------|:-------|:--------|:--------------|
| **GET** | Read/View | "Show me user 123" | ❌ No |
| **POST** | Create | "Add a new user" | ✅ Yes |
| **PUT** | Replace | "Replace user 123's info" | ✅ Yes |
| **DELETE** | Remove | "Delete user 123" | ✅ Yes |

<InfoBox type="tip">
  **Memory trick:** Think of CRUD operations!
  - **C**reate = POST
  - **R**ead = GET
  - **U**pdate = PUT
  - **D**elete = DELETE
</InfoBox>

## Section 2: Status Codes - The Server's Response 🚦

When you make a request, the server responds with a 3-digit number. Think of them like traffic lights!

### 🟢 2xx Series: Success! (Green Light)

Everything worked perfectly!

**200 OK** - "Here's what you asked for!"
```
GET /api/users/123
← 200 OK
{ "id": 123, "name": "John" }
```

**201 Created** - "I successfully created the new thing!"
```
POST /api/users
← 201 Created
{ "id": 456, "name": "Jane" }
```

**204 No Content** - "Done! But there's nothing to show you."
```
DELETE /api/users/123
← 204 No Content
```

### 🟡 4xx Series: You Made a Mistake (Yellow Light)

These mean **YOU** (the client/browser/app) did something wrong.

**400 Bad Request** - "I don't understand what you're asking for."
```
POST /api/users
Body: { "name": "" }  ← Empty name!
← 400 Bad Request
```

**401 Unauthorized** - "Who are you? Please log in first!"

**403 Forbidden** - "I know who you are, but you can't do that!"

**404 Not Found** - "I can't find what you're looking for."

<InfoBox type="warning">
  **401 vs 403 - What's the difference?**
  - **401:** "I don't know who you are" (not logged in)
  - **403:** "I know who you are, but you're not allowed" (logged in but no permission)
</InfoBox>

<ProgressCheckpoint section="4xx-codes" xpReward={2} />

### 🔴 5xx Series: Server Error (Red Light)

These mean the **SERVER** messed up. Not your fault!

**500 Internal Server Error** - "Something broke on our end. Sorry!"

**503 Service Unavailable** - "We're temporarily down. Try again later."
