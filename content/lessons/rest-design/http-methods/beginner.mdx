# HTTP Methods & Status Codes: The Language of the Web

When computers talk to each other on the web, they use a specific language. Just like you need verbs to communicate ("get," "create," "delete"), web APIs use **HTTP Methods**. And just like you need feedback ("done!", "error!"), APIs use **Status Codes**.

Let's learn this language together!

## The HTTP Methods: Your Action Verbs 🎬

Think of HTTP methods as commands you give to a librarian:

### 1. GET - "Please Show Me" 📖

**What it does:** Retrieves information without changing anything.

**Real-world analogy:** 
- Looking at a book in the library (you don't take it home)
- Checking your bank balance (just viewing, not withdrawing)
- Reading a menu at a restaurant

**Example:**
```
GET /api/users/123
→ "Show me information about user 123"
```

**Key rule:** GET should NEVER change data. It's read-only!

### 2. POST - "Please Add This" ➕

**What it does:** Creates something new.

**Real-world analogy:**
- Submitting a new library card application
- Posting a new photo on Instagram
- Placing an order at a restaurant

**Example:**
```
POST /api/users
Body: { "name": "John", "email": "john@example.com" }
→ "Create a new user with this information"
```

**Key rule:** POST creates new things. Each time you POST, you create another one!

### 3. PUT - "Replace Everything" 🔄

**What it does:** Replaces an entire resource with new data.

**Real-world analogy:**
- Replacing your entire profile information
- Rewriting a document completely
- Replacing all ingredients in a recipe

**Example:**
```
PUT /api/users/123
Body: { "name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com", "age": 30 }
→ "Replace ALL information for user 123 with this"
```

**Key rule:** You must send the COMPLETE object. Missing fields get deleted!

### 4. DELETE - "Remove This" 🗑️

**What it does:** Removes a resource.

**Real-world analogy:**
- Canceling your library card
- Deleting a photo from your phone
- Canceling an order

**Example:**
```
DELETE /api/users/123
→ "Remove user 123 from the system"
```

**Key rule:** Once deleted, it's gone! (Usually)

## Quick Comparison Table 📊

| Method | Action | Example | Changes Data? |
|:-------|:-------|:--------|:--------------|
| **GET** | Read/View | "Show me user 123" | ❌ No |
| **POST** | Create | "Add a new user" | ✅ Yes |
| **PUT** | Replace | "Replace user 123's info" | ✅ Yes |
| **DELETE** | Remove | "Delete user 123" | ✅ Yes |

<InfoBox type="tip">
  **Memory trick:** Think of CRUD operations!
  - **C**reate = POST
  - **R**ead = GET
  - **U**pdate = PUT
  - **D**elete = DELETE
</InfoBox>

## Status Codes: The Server's Response 🚦

When you make a request, the server responds with a 3-digit number. Think of them like traffic lights telling you what happened!

### 🟢 2xx Series: Success! (Green Light)

Everything worked perfectly!

**200 OK** - "Here's what you asked for!"
```
GET /api/users/123
← 200 OK
{ "id": 123, "name": "John" }
```

**201 Created** - "I successfully created the new thing!"
```
POST /api/users
← 201 Created
{ "id": 456, "name": "Jane" }
```

**204 No Content** - "Done! But there's nothing to show you."
```
DELETE /api/users/123
← 204 No Content
(No body - just success)
```

<ProgressCheckpoint section="2xx-codes" xpReward={5} />

### 🟡 4xx Series: You Made a Mistake (Yellow Light)

These mean **YOU** (the client/browser/app) did something wrong.

**400 Bad Request** - "I don't understand what you're asking for."
```
POST /api/users
Body: { "name": "" }  ← Empty name!
← 400 Bad Request
{ "error": "Name is required" }
```

**401 Unauthorized** - "Who are you? Please log in first!"
```
GET /api/account/settings
(No login token provided)
← 401 Unauthorized
{ "error": "Please log in" }
```

**403 Forbidden** - "I know who you are, but you can't do that!"
```
DELETE /api/users/123
(Regular user trying to delete someone)
← 403 Forbidden
{ "error": "Only admins can delete users" }
```

**404 Not Found** - "I can't find what you're looking for."
```
GET /api/users/99999
← 404 Not Found
{ "error": "User not found" }
```

<InfoBox type="warning">
  **401 vs 403 - What's the difference?**
  - **401:** "I don't know who you are" (not logged in)
  - **403:** "I know who you are, but you're not allowed" (logged in but no permission)
</InfoBox>

<ProgressCheckpoint section="4xx-codes" xpReward={5} />

### 🔴 5xx Series: Server Error (Red Light)

These mean the **SERVER** messed up. Not your fault!

**500 Internal Server Error** - "Something broke on our end. Sorry!"
```
GET /api/users/123
← 500 Internal Server Error
{ "error": "Database connection failed" }
```

**503 Service Unavailable** - "We're temporarily down. Try again later."
```
GET /api/users
← 503 Service Unavailable
{ "error": "Server is under maintenance" }
```

<InfoBox type="info">
  When you see a 5xx error, it's usually not something you can fix. The server team needs to investigate!
</InfoBox>

## Status Code Cheat Sheet 📝

| Code | Name | Meaning | When to Use |
|:-----|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| **200** | OK | Success | GET, PUT requests |
| **201** | Created | New resource created | POST requests |
| **204** | No Content | Success, no data to return | DELETE, PUT requests |
| **400** | Bad Request | Invalid data sent | Validation errors |
| **401** | Unauthorized | Not logged in | Missing auth token |
| **403** | Forbidden | No permission | Insufficient privileges |
| **404** | Not Found | Resource doesn't exist | Invalid ID |
| **500** | Server Error | Server crashed | Bugs, database errors |

## Real-World Example: Creating a User 👤

Let's see how methods and status codes work together:

**Scenario 1: Success**
```
POST /api/users
Body: { "name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com" }

← 201 Created
{
  "id": 789,
  "name": "Alice",
  "email": "alice@example.com"
}
```

**Scenario 2: Validation Error**
```
POST /api/users
Body: { "name": "", "email": "not-an-email" }

← 400 Bad Request
{
  "errors": {
    "name": "Name is required",
    "email": "Invalid email format"
  }
}
```

**Scenario 3: Not Logged In**
```
POST /api/users
(No authentication token)

← 401 Unauthorized
{
  "error": "Please log in to create users"
}
```

  question="You want to remove a user from the system. Which method should you use?"
  options={[
    "GET",
    "POST",
    "DELETE",
    "REMOVE"
  ]}
  correctAnswer={2}
  explanation="DELETE is the standard HTTP method for removing resources. REMOVE is not a real HTTP method!"

  question="You successfully created a new product. Which status code should the server return?"
  options={[
    "200 OK",
    "201 Created",
    "204 No Content",
    "301 Moved"
  ]}
  correctAnswer={1}
  explanation="201 Created is the correct status code for successful resource creation. It tells the client that a new resource was created."

<Quiz
  question="A user tries to access admin settings but they're not an admin. Which status code should you return?"
  options={[
    "401 Unauthorized",
    "403 Forbidden",
    "404 Not Found",
    "400 Bad Request"
  ]}
  correctAnswer={1}
  explanation="403 Forbidden is correct because the user is authenticated (we know who they are) but they don't have permission. 401 would be if they weren't logged in at all."

<Quiz
  question="Which HTTP method should NEVER change data on the server?"
  options={[
    "POST",
    "GET",
    "PUT",
    "DELETE"
  ]}
  correctAnswer={1}
  explanation="GET should always be read-only and never modify data. This allows GET requests to be cached safely and called multiple times without side effects."
