# ASP.NET Core Overview

ASP.NET Core is a **cross-platform, high-performance, open-source framework** for building modern, cloud-ready, internet-connected applications. It's a complete rewrite of ASP.NET Framework, designed for today's development needs.

## What Can You Build?

ASP.NET Core is versatile. You can create:

1. **Web APIs** - RESTful services that power mobile apps, SPAs, and microservices
2. **MVC Web Applications** - Server-rendered websites with Razor views
3. **Razor Pages** - Simplified page-focused web apps
4. **Real-time Applications** - Using SignalR for WebSocket communication
5. **gRPC Services** - High-performance RPC for service-to-service communication
6. **Blazor Apps** - Interactive web UIs using C# instead of JavaScript

## Framework vs Core: What Changed?

| ASP.NET Framework | ASP.NET Core |
|:------------------|:-------------|
| Windows only | Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS) |
| System.Web dependency | Modular with NuGet packages |
| IIS hosting only | Multiple hosting options (Kestrel, IIS, Docker) |
| Large memory footprint | Lightweight and fast |
| Closed development | Open source on GitHub |

## Architecture Highlights

### Request Pipeline

ASP.NET Core uses a **middleware pipeline** architecture. Each middleware component can:
- Handle the request and short-circuit the pipeline
- Pass the request to the next middleware
- Perform work before and after the next middleware

```csharp
// Each middleware processes requests in order
app.UseHttpsRedirection();
app.UseStaticFiles();
app.UseRouting();
app.UseAuthentication();
app.UseAuthorization();
app.MapControllers();
```

### Built-in Dependency Injection

Unlike its predecessor, ASP.NET Core has a **first-class DI container** built into the framework:

```csharp
// Register services
builder.Services.AddScoped<IUserService, UserService>();
builder.Services.AddDbContext<AppDbContext>();

// Inject anywhere
public class UserController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly IUserService _userService;
    
    public UserController(IUserService userService)
    {
        _userService = userService;
    }
}
```

## Performance Matters

ASP.NET Core consistently ranks among the **top-performing web frameworks** in industry benchmarks like TechEmpower. Key performance features:

- **Kestrel**: A blazing-fast, cross-platform web server
- **Async everywhere**: Built on async/await patterns
- **Memory efficiency**: Reduced allocations and smart pooling
- **Span<T> and Memory<T>**: Low-allocation APIs for high throughput
