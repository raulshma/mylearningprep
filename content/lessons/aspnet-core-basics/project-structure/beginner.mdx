# Project Structure

When you create a new ASP.NET Core project, you get a ready-made folder structure. Think of it like moving into a new apartment that already has rooms set up - you just need to know which room is for what!

## Your Project is Like a Well-Organized Kitchen 🍳

Imagine your project as a professional kitchen:

- **The Recipe Book** (`Program.cs`) - The main instructions for how everything runs
- **The Pantry** (`appsettings.json`) - Where you store ingredients (settings)
- **The Prep Stations** (`Controllers/` folder) - Where specific work happens
- **The Storage Room** (`Properties/`) - Behind-the-scenes organization

## The Most Important Files

When you're just starting, focus on these files:

### 1. Program.cs - The Boss 👔

This is where your app starts! It's like the head chef who decides the menu and assigns tasks to everyone.

### 2. appsettings.json - The Settings Menu ⚙️

This file stores configuration - like your database address, logging preferences, and other settings your app needs.

### 3. .csproj File - The Shopping List 📝

This tells .NET what packages (tools) your project needs, kind of like a shopping list for your project.

## Don't Worry About Everything!

When starting out, you don't need to understand every file. Focus on:

1. ✅ `Program.cs` - Where you'll add features
2. ✅ `appsettings.json` - Where you'll change settings
3. ⏳ Other files - Learn these as you need them

> **Tip**: The green-highlighted files in the explorer above are the most important ones to start with!
