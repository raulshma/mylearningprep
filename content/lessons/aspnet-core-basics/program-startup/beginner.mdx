# Program.cs & Startup

Every journey has a starting point, and for your ASP.NET Core app, that's `Program.cs`! Let's learn how your app wakes up and gets ready to work.

## The Main Entrance 🚪

Think of `Program.cs` like the **front door and reception desk** of a building:

1. **Opening the door** - Starting the application
2. **Setting up the lobby** - Preparing services your app needs
3. **Assigning directions** - Telling requests where to go

<DotnetCodePreview 
  code={`var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add services to the container
builder.Services.AddControllers();

var app = builder.Build();

// Configure the request pipeline
app.MapControllers();

app.Run();`}

## Breaking It Down Simply

### Step 1: Create the Builder 🔨

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
```

This is like hiring a contractor to build your app. The `builder` prepares everything you need.

### Step 2: Add Services 🧰

```csharp
builder.Services.AddControllers();
```

Services are like **hiring staff** for your building:
- `AddControllers()` = Hire API handlers
- `AddDbContext()` = Hire a database manager
- `AddAuthentication()` = Hire security guards

### Step 3: Build the App 🏗️

```csharp
var app = builder.Build();
```

Construction is done! Now you have your app ready to run.

### Step 4: Set Up the Pipeline 🔄

```csharp
app.MapControllers();
```

This tells requests where to go - like signs in a building pointing to different offices.

### Step 5: Run! 🚀

```csharp
app.Run();
```

Open for business! Your app starts listening for visitors (requests).

## Real-World Analogy

> **Program.cs is like opening a restaurant:**
> 
> 1. Build the kitchen (create builder)
> 2. Hire chefs, waiters, and cleaners (add services)
> 3. Set up the dining flow (configure pipeline)
> 4. Open the doors to customers (run)
