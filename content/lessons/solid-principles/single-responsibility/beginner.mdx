# Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

Imagine you hire an employee to be a chef. But then you also ask them to do the dishes, manage payroll, answer phones, AND fix the plumbing. How well do you think they'd cook? 🍳

**That's exactly the problem SRP solves!**

## Section 1: The Swiss Army Knife Problem 🔪

Think about two types of knives:

| **Swiss Army Knife** 🔧 | **Chef's Knife** 🔪 |
|:-------------------------|:--------------------|
| Can do many things | Does ONE thing |
| Okay at everything | Excellent at cutting |
| Jack of all trades | Master of one |
| Confusing to use | Clear purpose |

A professional chef uses a dedicated chef's knife, not a Swiss Army knife. Why? Because **specialized tools do their job better!**

<InfoBox type="tip">
**The SRP Says:** Each class should have only **ONE job** and only **ONE reason to change**.
</InfoBox>

### Real-World Analogy: The Restaurant 🍽️

Think of a well-run restaurant:

- **Chef** → Only cooks food
- **Waiter** → Only serves customers  
- **Cashier** → Only handles payments
- **Host** → Only seats guests

Each person has **ONE job**. If the chef also had to take payments, wait tables, AND seat guests, the kitchen would be chaos!

## Section 2: Let's See the Problem

Here's code that does TOO MANY things (just like our overworked employee):

### The Simple Rule

> **"A class should have only one reason to change."**
> — Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)

Ask yourself:
1. What does this class do?
2. Can I describe it in ONE sentence without using "AND"?

❌ **Bad:** "This class manages users AND sends emails AND generates reports."

✅ **Good:** "This class manages user data."

## Section 3: Why Does This Matter?

| **Without SRP** 😰 | **With SRP** 😊 |
|:-------------------|:----------------|
| Change one thing, break another | Changes are isolated |
| Hard to understand | Easy to understand |
| Difficult to test | Easy to test |
| Big, scary files | Small, focused files |

### Key Takeaways

<InfoBox type="tip" title="Remember">
- 📦 **One class = One job** (like one employee = one role)
- 🔧 Use **specialized classes** (not Swiss Army classes)
- 🧪 Smaller classes are **easier to test**
- 🔄 Changes stay **isolated** and safe
