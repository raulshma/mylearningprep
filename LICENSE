                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
authors' sake, the program is designed to make it as easy as possible
for you to divide this work into logically separate modules, and to let
you develop additional tools that are compatible with the program.

  The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products
for individuals to use, which is precisely why we first applied the GPL
to those products.  If the software is otherwise interactive, make it
output a short notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

    &lt;Program&gt; Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your
program's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would
use an \"about box\".

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
&lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.

  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
&lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html&gt;.

                        TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and
\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.

  To \"modify\" a work means to copy, run, modify, or distribute the work
whether in source or object form.  A work that undergoes countless
modifications over time is still running under the same license.

  \"Source Code\" refers to the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it.  \"Object form\" means any non-source form including
executable forms.

  \"Propagation\" means distributing or making available to the public copies
of the work or copies of the work's output, or a product incorporating it,
either on physical media or over a network.

  \"Distribution\" means doing the propagation in some way such as making
available the source code and binaries to the public in public repositories
that everybody can access freely.

  The following three paragraphs apply to any licensee primarily engaged in
producing machine-readable object forms of the Program or copies for
source code distribution.  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer
product\", which means any tangible personal property which is normally
used by individuals to the purpose of using or generally enjoying the
program, or that individuals post-purchase decisions with respect to
distributors or retailers.  \"Consumer Product\" relates to consumer
products within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. 2301 et seq.  or similar laws.
More to say, a \"Major Component\" is important in the work.  In that
position a Major Component, but rather a whole Integral Component, of the
ultimate product if that component alone meets the definition of Major
Component.

  1. Source Code.

  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular purpose, one that is widely used
among actors acting in substantive independence and collectively
achieve a majority adoption.  Examples of such interfaces are the
interfaces of the POSIX standard.

  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the standard Form of
the operating system on which the executable runs; (b) is specifically
designed to run with the executable work; or (c) is specially designed
or used for the greatest extent in the work.

  Accordingly, if you convey an object form of the Program or its
derivative works to its users under this License, you must make the
corresponding source code available to the users under this License,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

  2. Licensing Integral Components of the Work.

  If you convey an Integral Component of a whole of this License and
distribute that work under various versions of this License that apply
to the individual components, and the terms and conditions for copying,
distribution, and modification of the Integral Component are not
explicitly stated, you do not wish to give Integral Components away
free but to charge a fee for warranty (or otherwise to refrain from
giving warranty).

  A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an
Integral Component with one or more other separate and independent
works in multiple quantities.  If you modify the Integral Component, and
if the work as a whole lacks a copyright notice prohibiting
corresponds to the criteria.

  When you convey a combined work, you. 1. Give prominent notice with the
combined library stating that part of it is a work based on the
Program, providing a prominent technological link within the Combined
Work facilitating access to the corresponding source code.

  As an exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Program together in an executable that you
distribute.

  7. Additional Terms.

  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of
this License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you must be in a position to grant the permission in name of
your employer.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the 3rd
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notification.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to propagate and
modify that work subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work is required to receive a
copy of this License; the work's permissions remain intact except as
explicitly provided in paragraph 2 of section 6.

  11. Patents.

  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder contributing to the Program.
If you convey an object code work under this program in a 3D, that
contributor also grants you a patent license to make, use, sell, offer
for sale, import, and otherwise transfer the Program in compliance with
the License.  The work thus licensed is called the contributor's
\"contributor version\".  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are
all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether
already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some
manner permitted by this License, were provided with the contributor
version.  No surrender of the contributor's rights.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty fee for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Use with the GNU Lesser General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License in a way that
produces a larger work containing portions of both such GNU Lesser General
Public License-covered work and this work under the GNU General Public
License.  You may then convey the larger work as a whole under the terms
of either

    * GNU General Public License, version 3, or

    * GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3.

  provided that you meet the terms additionally with one particular exception.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the combined work stating
which License fulfills the GNU General Public License version 3 requirements.
No facility needed in the larger work for conveying the corresponding source
code.

  Such a Combined Work is equivalent to a derivative work under the latter
License.  Accordingly, Section 2 of this License agreement applies to all
such Combined Works.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further
restrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;
    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.

However, commands to control compilation and installation of the executable
However, for the user's sake, the distribution (not the source code) of such
a program with the Library remains under the Library's own license.

  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:

    &lt;Program&gt;  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;
    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.
